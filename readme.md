#Initial Planning: When starting this project off, I really wanted to do something featuring music, concerts, and live shows in general. I go to concerts fairly frequently and enjoy live music quite a bit so I decided to take that route. After some thought, I decided to make an app that would help you keep track of all the live shows that you would want to attend based on following your favorite artists 

#Technology used: This app features Javascript and EJS for the front end, and SQL/Sequelize for the back end. It also utlizes the Last.fm and Songkick APIs to track artists/add them to your favorites, let you know if they are on tour or not, and give you a list of related artists when you add them to your favorites for you to check out.


#MVP:

- Authentication - sign up, login, and logout
- Utilize 2 different APIs (Last.fm and Songkick)
- Be able to search the APIs for artists and check if they are on tour.
- Display information about the artists when you search for them (pulled from the APIs)
- Add artists to your favorites
- Add songs from your favorite artists to your favorites and display them on your profile.


#Stretch Goals
- Mobile friendly
- Multiple users
- Chat interface
- Take songs/artists/tours from other profiles and add them to your favorites.
